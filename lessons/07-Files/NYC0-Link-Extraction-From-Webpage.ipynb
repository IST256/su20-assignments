    "# Now You Code 0: Extracting Hyperlinks from a Webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a program which extracts the hyperlinks from a Webpage. There are 3 webpage files you can try with this program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "file = 'NYC0-httpbin-org.html'\n",
    "file = 'NYC0-ischool-website.html'\n",
    "file = 'NYC0-wikipedia-President-of-the-United-States.html'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here's the basic strategy: you should be looking for the following token in the text of the file `<a href=\"` when you find this token the link is all characters until the second `\"` character. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `<a href=\"http://ist256.github.io\">` the Hyperlink would be: `http://ist256.github.io`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended approach (the problem simplification technique):\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the problem simplification technique to solve this problem. It works by solving a simpler problem then taking what you've learned to solve a more complicated problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to extract `http://ist256.github.io` from the string `<a href=\"http://ist256.github.io\">` in Python code\n",
    "2. Then read in the `file = 'NYC0-httpbin-org.html'` text file into a variable, and use the same code in step 1. to extract the first Hyperlink in the text. For `file = 'NYC0-httpbin-org.html'` It will be `https://github.com/requests/httpbin`\n",
    "3. Finally try to figure out how to use a loop to extract all the urls in the string text you read from the file. For `file = 'NYC0-httpbin-org.html'` you should get these Hyperlinks: `https://github.com/requests/httpbin`, `https://kennethreitz.org`, `mailto:me@kennethreitz.org`, `/forms/post`\n",
    "\n",
    "A little HTML primer - there are 4 types of hyperlinks you will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- those which begin with `http` are external links to other pages off site.\n",
    "- those which begin with `mailto` are links to email addresses\n",
    "- those which begin with a `/` are internal links other pages on the same website\n",
    "- those which begin with a `#` are internal links to places on the same page\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything else is not a link and you're probably extracting incorrectly."

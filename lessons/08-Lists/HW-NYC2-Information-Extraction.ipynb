    "# Now You Code 2: Information Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we make computers seem intelligent? One approach is to use *term extraction*. Term extration is a type of information extration where we attempt to find relevant terms in text. The relevant terms come from a *corpus*, or set of plausible terms we want to extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "`One day I would like to visit Syracuse`\n",
    "\n",
    "We as smart humans can be fairly confident that `Syracuse` is a place, more specifically a `city`. \n",
    "\n",
    "A rudimentary method to make the computer interpret `Syracuse` as a place is to provide a corpus of cities and have the computer look up `Syracuse` in that corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this code exercise we will do just that. Let's first write a function to read cities from the file `NYC2-cities.txt` into a corpus of cities, which will be represented in Python as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then write a main program loop to input some text, split the text into a list of words and if any of the words match a city in the corpus list we will output the word is a city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should handle upper / lower case matching. A good approach is to title case the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: Please note that our program will ONLY work for one word cities, like `Syracuse` and will not work for multiple-word cities like `San Diego`. Don't worry about that now. \n",
    "\n",
    "SAMPLE RUN\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter some text (or ENTER to quit): one day I would like to visit syracuse and rochester\n",
    "Syracuse is a city\n",
    "Rochester is a city\n",
    "Enter some text (or ENTER to quit): austin is in texas\n",
    "Austin is a city\n",
    "Enter some text (or ENTER to quit): \n",
    "Quitting...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again we will solve this problem using the problem simplification approach. First we will write the `load_city_corpus` function to build our city list. Second we will write the  `is_a_city` function which given a word and a city list will return `True` when the word is a city. Finally we conclude with the main program which finds cities in our text, as demonstrated in our sample run."

Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n",

    "- Everyday quality paint is `$19.99` per gallon.\n",
    "- Select quality paint is `$24.99` per gallon.\n",
    "- Premium quality paint is `$32.99` per gallon.\n",

    "In addition if the customer wants computerized color-matching that incurs an additional fee of `$4.99` per gallon. \n",

    "Write a program to ask the user to select a paint quality: 'everyday', 'select' or 'premium', prompt for color matching, and then outputs the price per gallon of the paint.\n",

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n",
